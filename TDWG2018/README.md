# Names for Biodiversity Workshop

## Introduction

Recent work on names is fragmented into individual and isolated project efforts. There are now more terms than concepts, more definitions than terms. Many, more-or-less, similar vocabularies, alternative frameworks and non-interoperable, application systems.

This may well be the natural process of evolution but we do need to make time now to discuss synthesis and a more collaborative approach to development of a workable standard for names. Can we work together to fill the gaps, and to resolve the competing requirements of aggregation and science, data and knowledge, product and research, Code-compliance and interoperability.

## Purpose

To raise awareness of the importance of names to biodiversity informatics and to re-invigorate a more collaborative phase of standards development with names within the TDWG umbrella.

This workshop will aim for consensus around the idea that we can work together within TDWG to evolve a pragmatic replacement for the existing names standards, and a map to get us there.

## Goals

1.  Reconvene the [Taxonomic Names and Concepts Interest Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/tnc/)
    - Membership
    - GitHub, [tdwg/tnc](https://github.com/tdwg/tnc)
    - Standards maintenance.
2.  Agreement on a plan for a replacement of the **Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema (TCS)** that:
    - is compliant with the TDWG [Standards Documentation Standard](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/tree/master/sds) and [Vocabulary Maintenance Standard](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/tree/master/vms).
    - provides for the needs of the various types of users and use cases of Taxonomic Names in the biodiversity informatics space
    - as much as possible synthesises and takes benefit of the work that has been done in the TDWG community so far.

##  Uses / Stakeholders

- Simple checklists, aggregators: GBIF, ALA, CoL
- Species Information Systems
- Floras, Faunas etc.
- Systems that capture historical (as well as current) name usages: NSL, APNI, AFD
- Systems that try to capture phylogenetic relationships

## Current standards

- [Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema (TCS)](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/tcs/)
-	[Darwin Core](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/)
